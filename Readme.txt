    This is a youtube browser for smplayer. You can browse, search, download
    and play youtube videos. The videos are currently played in smplayer but
    in the future it may be added the possibility to use other players.

    The code has been taken from UMPlayer (http://www.umplayer.com). I made
    some modifications to make it a stand-alone application and added a few 
    improvements.
